Say you have an IRA or some sort of investing account, and you own 100 shares of stock XYZ. Since you own this stock, you are probably bullish on it long term. However, as of right now,
the stock might be relatively stable. Instead of just letting it sit, you can do something called a covered call, which ***generates consistent income but limits your upside***.
If you bought XYZ at $20 and it is currently still $20, we can sell a 25C XYZ a week out, collecting a premium of maybe $20(1%)~.


After a week, there are three possible outcomes. Either XYZ closes between 20-25, below 20, or above 25. If XYZ closes above 25$, we have our shares called away, we gain $$(25-20)*100+20=520$$
in profit. We can choose to rebuy XYZ at a higher stock price and repeat this process, or if we think XYZ is overvalued, we can repeat this with some other stock.
